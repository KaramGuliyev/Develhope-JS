// Explain the difference between the double and the triple equals operator.

const firstYearCompleted = true;
const yearsCompleted = 1;

console.log(yearsCompleted == firstYearCompleted);
console.log(yearsCompleted === firstYearCompleted);

// As I said before == is only value comparison, but === is compares types too beside to values
